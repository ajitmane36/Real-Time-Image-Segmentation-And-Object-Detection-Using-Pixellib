# Real-Time Image Segmentation and Object Detection Using PixelLib

This project demonstrates real-time image segmentation and object detection using the PixelLib library and a pre-trained Mask R-CNN model. The application captures video from your default camera, applies instance segmentation, and displays the results with bounding boxes around detected objects.

## Features

- Real-time video capture from your camera.
- Instance segmentation using the Mask R-CNN model.
- Bounding boxes and labels for detected objects.
